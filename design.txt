In Developing API's for game "Hangman", following additional properties
are added to model:
In Game: Added letters_guessed : to keep a list of all the letters guessed by
        Player during the game. When the player make a move, guess letter is
        checked, whether it is in this list. If so, then user is told, and
        user loose no chance in case if letter is already guessed before.
        Added game_history: is a list of strings, that store all the moves
        played by player. This is used later in api when user ask to get all
        the moves of a game.
Added Model Performace: Fields: Performance, Rank, Name. Holds performance of
            each player. When USer asks for Ranking, then performance, ranking
            of each player is calculated and Performance table is populated.

Hangman Logic was not too hard, only thing was to update the number of attempts
in the database at right time during the game and letter_guessed by Player.
