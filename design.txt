In Developing API's for game "Hangman", following additional properties
are added to model:
In Game: Added letters_guessed : to keep a list of all the letters guessed by
        Player during the game. When the player make a move, guess letter is
        checked, whether it is in this list. If so, then user is told, and
        user loose no chance in case if letter is already guessed before.
        Added game_history: is a list of strings, that store all the moves
        played by player. This is used later in api when user ask to get all
        the moves of a game.
In Score: Added Performance property which holds performance of each player.
          When Score is populated(during game over), performace of User gets
          caculated based on number of attempts remaining and total number of
          attempts. This is converted into percentage. And this property is
          later used by API to get the ranking of all players.

Hangman Logic was not too hard, only thing was to update the number of attempts
in the database at right time during the game and letter_guessed by Player.
